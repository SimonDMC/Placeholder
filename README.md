*Placeholder* is a puzzle map that will take you on the journey of a player exploring an incomplete build site. Here, you must **solve puzzles** and find **unintended mechanics** in order to progress. Explore your surroundings, find secrets and create a path of your own.
Featuring a voice-acted storyline and seven custom builds, this map will put your problem solving skills to the test.

*[Keep in mind this description is only a **Placeholder**]*.
