## About the map

<img src="https://simondmc.com/media/imgs/logos/placeholder.webp" alt="placeholder" width="450"/>

_Placeholder_ is a puzzle map that will take you on the journey of a player exploring an incomplete build site. Here, you must **solve puzzles** and find **unintended mechanics** in order to progress. Explore your surroundings, find secrets and create a path of your own.
Featuring a voice-acted storyline and seven custom builds, this map will put your problem solving skills to the test.

_[Keep in mind this description is only a **Placeholder**]_.
